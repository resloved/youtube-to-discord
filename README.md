# youtube-to-discord
Push new videos from you favorite youtube channel to your [discord](https://discordapp.com/) server.

## Usage
Videocheck requires:

* CHAN_ID as the ID of the youtube channel you would like to check
* DEV_KEY as the key from your google dev account. (Get yours [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/))

Bot requires:

* BOT_EMAIL as the email of the bot you would like to post updates.
* BOT_PASS as the email of the bot you would like to post updates.
* CHAN_ID as the discord channel you would like the updates to be posted to.

After all of the login requirements are set, all you have to do is run the bot file and it should handle the rest.

If you would like the bot to check more/less often just change the 'WAIT' variable.
